### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Business Mathematics student with a strong passion for Data Science. 
During my apprenticeship program, I managed to become the extended data science team and create an application using R and Shiny for TAM. 
I also gave talk about time series and stock analysis in a R community. 
Currently pursuing my dream to become a full stack developer while doing some consultancy projects in my company. 
If you want to share your learning journey to become a full stack developer or ask me anything about my experience, let's connect through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aurellia-christie-059892179/).
Have a nice day!ðŸ˜„
